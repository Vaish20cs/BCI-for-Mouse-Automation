Project revolutionizes human-computer interaction by integrating EEG signals for eye movement control and accelerometer sensors for head movement tracking.
This innovative approach offers users a natural and intuitive method for mouse automation, enhancing accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities or limitations.
By relying on brain signals, eye movements, and head movements, our system provides an alternative input method that empowers users to interact with technology effortlessly.
BCI system design integrating SSVEP (Steady State Visually Evoked Potential) signals for eye-tracking with accelerometer data for head movement detection.
Offers precise cursor control by combining eye-tracking and head movement detection.
Provides users with a comprehensive and intuitive means of interacting with technology.
