# BCI-for-Mouse-Automation
Brain-Computer Interface for Mouse Automation is a project aims to create a system that uses EEG signals to interpret eye movements and accelerometer sensors to track head movements. This system is designed to automate mouse control, making computer interaction easier for people with disabilities.

system achieves exceptional performance, with an average accuracy of 89 percent in classifying combined eye and head movements.

The model's performance in classifying each class label is shown in the confusion matrix.
We’ve trained a model to recognize four distinct classes corresponding to mouse pointer movements —left,right, forward, and backward.
