SSVEP Database from 4 participants performing a 4-target selection task.
All datasets were collected on channels Fp1, Fp2 and A2 according to the 10â€“20 EEG electrode placement standard.
Accelerometer data from 4 participants performing 4 tasks (Left, Right, Rear and Front.
FP1 and FP2 are EEG electrode placements located on the frontal pole of the head.
They are positioned on the scalp above the left (FP1) and right (FP2) prefrontal cortex, respectively.
A2 is an EEG electrode placement typically positioned on the outer side of the right earlobe.
It serves as a reference electrode, providing a baseline signal against which other electrodes' signals are compared.
